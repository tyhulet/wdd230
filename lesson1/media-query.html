            <p>I, Nephi, having been aborn of bgoodly cparents, therefore I was dtaught somewhat in all the learning of
                my father; and having seen many eafflictions in the course of my days, nevertheless, having been highly
                favored of the Lord in all my days; yea, having had a great knowledge of the goodness and the mysteries
                of God, therefore I make a frecord of my proceedings in my days.</p>

                pass away, my aword shall not pass away, but shall all be bfulfilled, whether by mine own cvoice or by
                the dvoice of my eservants, it is the fsame.</p>
